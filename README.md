# GreekEasy
21W.789 Spring 2015

GreekEasy is an iPhone application created for MIT's 21W.789 class in spring 2015. It is an event, chore, and reimbursement manager for fraternities and sororities. It uses Parse for backend functions such as a database, and functionality such as push notifications(currently bugged) and user accounts.

The app itself is located within the TestApp folder. All other files and folders are related assignments for the class.
